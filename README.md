# mpSTAR-pages

## Hello!
This repository should not be very interesting to anyone. This repo is just a collection of the .html files used for the mp* class during my time at Clarkson University.

It is easier to keep things here for memory sake. Nothing more about it than that.

If you want to look to see what I have done in COSI through the eyes of someone watching me get a pass/fail grade, you are in the right place!
