                How are you doing Krusty Krew? It is about midnight and instead of doing AOC like yall I am stuck doing homework. <br>
                I was watching Andor for my 10 minute break and just decided that star wars should be doable for my mp* project right? <br>
                Anyways, I am super tired and I hope I just forget about everything I wrote while I am presenting this and that I actually get to do all that I wanted to do with this project. WHICH inlcuded having a lil death star in the corner that I would then click and it would shoot this tesxt and it would be all done. I hope that is implemented. <br>
                Just for the sake of this not all being useless, I am going to add in the actuall vital things for this dang mp* <br>
                Wait, first lemme push <br>
                Okay, done <br>
                I just tested this and it does look a bit weird, but its finals week so I got an excuse okay! <br>
